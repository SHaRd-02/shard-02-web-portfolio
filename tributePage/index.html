                <h2>What is Mistborn? </h2>
                <p id="tribute-info">Mistborn is a captivating fantasy book series crafted by the brilliant mind of Brandon Sanderson. Set in a meticulously constructed universe, Mistborn takes readers on an exhilarating journey through a realm where magic, politics, and intrigue intertwine in a mesmerizing tapestry. </p>
                
                <p>With its richly developed characters, intricate plot twists, and meticulously detailed world-building, the series has garnered widespread acclaim from both readers and critics alike. As the saga unfolds across multiple volumes, readers are immersed in a world where Allomancers wield the power of metals, propelling them into a conflict that will shape the fate of their world.</p> 
                <p>Through the eyes of compelling protagonists and antagonists, Sanderson explores themes of power, sacrifice, and redemption, creating a literary masterpiece that continues to captivate and inspire readers worldwide.</p>
                
                <p>The Mistborn series is an integral part of the larger Cosmere universe created by author Brandon Sanderson. While each series within the Cosmere stands alone with its own unique setting, characters, and storyline, they are all interconnected through a shared cosmology and underlying narrative framework.</p>
                
                <p>The Mistborn series is divided into distinct eras, each offering a unique perspective on the world of Scadrial and its inhabitants.</p>
                
                <h2>Allomancy</h2>
                
                <P>Allomancy is a central magical system in the Mistborn series. It's a power wielded by certain individuals known as Mistings or Mistborn, who are able to ingest and "burn" specific metals to access various supernatural abilities</P>
                <p>The foundation of Allomancy lies in the ingestion and metabolization of specific metals. Each metal grants the Allomancer a specific ability when "burned," which involves ingesting the metal and then drawing upon its power within themselves. The types of Allomantic metals and their corresponding abilities are divided into two main categories: internal and external metals.</p>
                <p>Internal metals provide abilities that directly affect the Allomancer's body or mind. For example</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burning iron allows an Allomancer to pull on nearby sources of metal, effectively allowing them to attract objects made of metal toward themselves.</li>
                    <li>Burning pewter enhances the Allomancer's physical abilities, granting increased strength, speed, and endurance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>External metals provide abilities that manipulate the environment or others:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Burning steel allows an Allomancer to push on nearby sources of metal, effectively allowing them to push away objects made of metal or launch themselves into the air.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Burning zinc or brass allows an Allomancer to influence the emotions of others nearby, either increasing or dampening their emotions, respectively.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Mistings are individuals who can only burn one specific metal, while Mistborn have the rare ability to burn all of the known Allomantic metals. The powers of Allomancy play a significant role in the politics, culture, and conflicts within the Mistborn series, shaping the world of Scadrial and the characters' destinies
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sanderson's intricate and well-defined system of Allomancy, with its clear rules and limitations, adds depth and complexity to the magic system of the Mistborn series, contributing to its appeal and immersive storytelling.
                </p>
                <p> It's explained that the power of Allomancy, along with other magical abilities like Feruchemy and Hemalurgy, is derived from the Shards Preservation and Ruin, two of the sixteen powerful entities that resulted from the shattering of Adonalsium, the original divine being in the Cosmere.</p>

                <h2>Era 1</h2>
                <p>The first era, often referred to as the "Original Trilogy," comprises the initial three books: "Mistborn: The Final Empire," "Mistborn: The Well of Ascension," and "Mistborn: The Hero of Ages." Set in a world dominated by a tyrannical immortal emperor, the series follows a crew of rebels led by the charismatic and resourceful Kelsier as they seek to overthrow the oppressive regime and fulfill an ancient prophecy that promises to bring about change to their world</p>
                <p>On Classical Scadrial, the sun and sky are red, vegetation is brown, and the ground is constantly being covered under black volcanic ash falls. Every night, the land becomes covered in an unnatural fog, known as the "mists". One thousand years before the story begins, the ruler of the Final Empire, the Lord Ruler, gained access to a divine power at the "Well of Ascension", where he is rumored to have defeated the unknown danger called the "Deepness". With this power, he remade the world and everything in it into its state at the beginning of the first three books. After this event, he established "The Final Empire", which he would rule over for the next thousand years.</p>

                <h2>Era 2</h2>
                <p>The second era, known as the "Wax and Wayne" series, diverges from the events of the first trilogy and introduces readers to a new cast of characters in a later period of Scadrial's history. This era begins with "Mistborn: The Alloy of Law," followed by "Mistborn: Shadows of Self," and "Mistborn: The Bands of Mourning." Set in a time of industrialization and technological advancement, this series follows the adventures of lawman Waxillium Ladrian and his eccentric partner Wayne as they navigate a world rife with political intrigue, criminal syndicates, and newfound Allomantic abilities</p>
                
                <p>In the "Wax and Wayne" series, Sanderson not only delves into the evolution of society and technology but also explores the legacy of the events and characters from the original Mistborn trilogy. While the world has progressed technologically, with trains and electricity now commonplace, echoes of the past still reverberate through the streets of Elendel. Old alliances and rivalries resurface, and the consequences of actions taken centuries before continue to shape the present.</p>
                <p>One of the most compelling aspects of this era is the dynamic between Waxillium Ladrian and his partner, Wayne. Wax, with his stoic determination and adherence to duty, contrasts sharply with Wayne's irreverent humor and penchant for bending the rules. Their friendship and complementary skills make them a formidable duo, but they also face personal struggles and conflicts as they grapple with the weight of their responsibilities and the ghosts of their pasts.</p>

                <h2>Era 3</h2>
                <p>Beyond these two eras, Brandon Sanderson has hinted at additional stories set in the Mistborn universe, promising further exploration of Scadrial's past, present, and future. </p>
                <P>Brandon has stated that an era three is confirm, and it's going to be set in a cold war enviroment. The protagonist is going to be alomantic girl, and we are going to see the birth of computers and programming in Scadrial.</P>
                <p>As with the previous eras, fans can expect Sanderson's trademark blend of intricate world-building, compelling characters, and epic storytelling to continue in the third era of the Mistborn series. While the specifics may still be shrouded in mystery, anticipation runs high for the next installment in this beloved fantasy saga.</p>
